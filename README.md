# Energy-Price-Forecasting

This project is about time series data forecasting. I apply a number of different models to explore the data and predict energy prices in the future. 

The data set PJM East Region: 2001-2018 (PJME) is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption. It consists of the estimated energy consumption in Megawatts (MW).

The analysis in the code folder can be used to obtain the models in the models folder.
